# 21SchoolProjects

There're some projects, created during my study in 21 Programming School. I'm still there, so list will increase. The most part of my beginner's code will be improved in course of training. Some projects were built by me and my fellow mates, so I will change only my own part.

All projects stored in folders divided by branch/pool/internship. Small explanation down here :)

21's study plan has several branches:

- Unix gives you a chance to write your own OS (actually, rewrite existing);
- Graphics teaches to create vintage versions of Doom, TempleRun, Minecraft and other funny things;
- Algorithms speaks for itself and moreover, helps to understand CS fundamentals, such as data structures and computing systems, and leads to AI projects;
- Network and system administration branch introduces you basics of server management and Docker.

Our first projects should be written in C. Then, School offers us "pools" - two-week camps with tasks in choosing language or technology. Now we could have pools in PHP(+HTML/CSS/JS), C++, Swift, Python (+Django), Ruby on Rails, OCaml, Unity.

Also, by the end of the course we should have at least 2 internships or part-time job in our specialization.
